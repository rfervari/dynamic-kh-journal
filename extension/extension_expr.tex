It is easy to see that $\KHiMLlogic$ is strictly more expressive than $\KHilogic$: two models can depict an agent with the same abilities, thus indistinguishable for the second, and yet use different witness for that, thus distinguishable for the first. \carlos{No se pueden usar modelos anteriores para hacer este claim más formal? En particular, no usaría la palabra "abilities" acá.}
Moreover, $\KHiMLlogic$ is also strictly more expressive than the standard multi-modal language $\mathsf{L}_{\square}$, as the global modality is definable in the former, but not in the latter.
