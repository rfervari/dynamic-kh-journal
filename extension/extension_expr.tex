Some details expressivity-wise. Note how $\KHiMLlogic$ is strictly more expressive than $\KHilogic$: two models can depict an agent with the same abilities, thus indistinguishable for the second, and yet use different witness for that, thus distinguishable for the first. Moreover, $\KHiMLlogic$ is also strictly more expressive than the standard multi-modal language $\mathsf{L}_{\square}$, as the global modality is definable in the first.
