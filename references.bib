We study the model checking and satisfiability decision problems. Through a notion of regular expression rewriting, we reduce these two problems to the corresponding ones of PDL in the traditional semantics (w.r.t. LTS). As for the complexity, both of problems are proved to be Expspace-complete. Moreover, the program complexity of model checking problem turns out to be Nlogspace-complete. Furthermore, we provide an axiomatization for PDL which involves Kleene Algebra as an Oracle. The soundness and completeness are shown.},

We develop a 3-valued version of Public Announcement Logic (PAL) which has a dynamic operator that changes the model in the spirit of public broadcasting. We prove that the refinement relation on static models assures us to safely reason about any dynamic properties in terms of PAL-formulas on the abstraction of a model. The theory is in particular interesting and applicable for an epistemic setting as the example of the Muddy Children puzzle shows, especially in the view of the growing interest for epistemic modelling and (automatic) verification of communication protocols.},

    abstract = {This paper presents an algorithm for a non-standard logic-minimization problem that arises in 3-valued propositional logic. The problem is motivated by the potential for obtaining better answers in applications that use 3-valued logic. An answer of 0 or 1 provides precise (definite) information; an answer of 1/2 provides imprecise (indefinite) information. By replacing a formula \varphi with a "better" formula \psi, we may improve the precision of the answers obtained. In this paper, we give an algorithm that always produces a formula that is "best" (in a certain well-defined sense).},

Indeed, abstractions specified in 3-valued models are able to distinguish properties that are true, false and unknown of the concrete system, and hence their analysis can yield correctness proofs and counter-examples that can be both guaranteed to be sound. In this paper, we study several 3-valued modeling formalisms proposed in the literature and show that they have the same expressiveness, in the sense that any model specified in any of these formalisms can be translated into a model specified in any other. We also show that the complexity of the model checking and generalized model checking problems does not change from one formalism to the other.},

These algorithms can perform exhaustive verification in a highly automatic manner, and, thus, have attracted much interest in industry. Model checking programs are now being commercially marketed. However, model checking has been held back by the state explosion problem, which is the problem that the number of states in a system grows exponentially in the number of system components. Much research has been devoted to ameliorating this problem.},

@techreport{Pratt76:PDL,
    abstract = {This paper deals with logics of programs. The objective is to formalize a notion of program description and to give both plausible (semantic) and effective (syntactic) criteria for the notion of truth of a description. A novel feature of this treatment is the development of the mathematics underlying Floyd-Hoare axiom systems independently of such systems. Other directions that such research might take are also considered. This paper grew out of, and is intended to be usable as, class notes for an introductory semantics course. The three sections of the paper are: 1) A frame work for the logic of programs. Programs and their partial correctness theories are treated as binary relations on states and formulae respectively. Truth-values are assigned to partial correctness assertions in a plausible (Tarskian) but not directly usable way. 2) Particular Programs. Effective criteria for truth are established for some programs using the Tarskian criteria as a benchmark. This leads directly to a sound, complete, effective axiom system for the theories of these programs. The difficulties involved in finding such effective criteria for other programs are explored. 3) Variations and extensions of the framework. Alternatives to binary relations for both programs and theories are speculated on, and their possible roles in semantics are considered. We discuss a hierarchy of varieties of programs and the importance of this hierarchy to the issues of definability and describability. Modal logic is considered as a first-order alternative to Floyd-Hoare logic. We give an appropriate axiom system which is complete for loop-free programs and also puts conventional predicate calculus in a different light by lumping quantifiers with non-logical assignments rather than treating them as logical concepts.},

    abstract = {We extend labelled transition systems to distributed transition systems by labelling the transition relation with a finite set of actions, representing the fact that the actions occur as a concurrent step . We design an addition-based temporal logic in which one can explicity talk about steps. The logic is studied to establish a variety of positive and negative results in terms of axiomatizability and decidability. Our positive results show that the step notion is amenable to logical treatment via standard techniques. They also help us to obtain a logical characterization of two well known models for distributed systems: labelled elementary net systems and labelled prime event structures. Our negative results show that demanding deterministic structures when dealing with a "non-interleaved" notion of transitions is, from a logical standpoint, very expressive. They also show that another well known model of distributed systems called asynchronous transition systems exhibits a surprising amount of expressive power in a natural logical setting.},

A proposition is local for this agent whenever his view suffices to decide this proposition. Motivated by a framework for the development of distributed programs from  gknowledge-based specifications, we introduce a modal logic of local propositions, in which it is possible to quantify over such propositions. We show that this logic is able to represent a rich set of epistemic notions. Under the usual strong semantics, this logic is not recursively axiomatizable, however. We show that by weakening the semantics of quantification, it is possible to obtain a logic that is axiomatizable and is still able to express interesting epistemic notions.},

We prove that, over the class of finitely branching trees, this extension is equally expressive to plain monadic second-order logic of order. Additionally we find that the continuum hypothesis holds for classes of sets definable in monadic second-order logic over finitely branching trees, which is notable for not all of these classes are analytic. Our approach is based on Shelah's composition method and uses basic results from descriptive set theory. The elimination result is constructive, yielding a decision procedure for the extended logic. Furthermore, by the well-known correspondence between monadic second-order logic and tree automata, our findings translate to analogous results on the extension of first-order logic by cardinality quantifiers over injectively presentable Rabin-automatic structures, generalizing the work of Kuske and Lohrey.},

@inproceedings{CC77:absInt,
    abstract = {A program denotes computations in some universe of objects. Abstract interpretation of programs consists in using that denotation to describe computations in another universe of abstract objects, so that the results of abstract execution give some information on the actual computations. An intuitive example (which we borrow from Sintzoff [72]) is the rule of signs. The text -1515 * 17 may be understood to denote computations on the abstract universe {(+), (-), (\&plusmn;)} where the semantics of arithmetic operators is defined by the rule of signs. The abstract execution -1515 * 17 \&rarr; -(+) * (+) \&rarr; (-) * (+) \&rarr; (-), proves that -1515 * 17 is a negative number. Abstract interpretation is concerned by a particular underlying structure of the usual universe of computations (the sign, in our example). It gives a summary of some facets of the actual executions of a program. In general this summary is simple to obtain but inaccurate (e.g. -1515 + 17 \&rarr; -(+) + (+) \&rarr; (-) + (+) \&rarr; (\&plusmn;)). Despite its fundamentally incomplete results abstract interpretation allows the programmer or the compiler to answer questions which do not need full knowledge of program executions or which tolerate an imprecise answer, (e.g. partial correctness proofs of programs ignoring the termination problems, type checking, program optimizations which are not carried in the absence of certainty about their feasibility, \&hellip;).},

    abstract = {We have developed a formal validation tool that has been used on several projects that are developing software for AT\&amp;amp;T's 5ESS \&amp;trade;  telephone switching system. The tool uses Holzmann's supertrace algorithm to check for errors such as deadlock and livelock in networks of communicating processes. The validator invariably finds subtle errors that were missed during thorough simulation and testing; however, the brute-force search it performs can result in extremely long running times, which can be frustrating to users. Recently, a number of researchers have been investigating techniques known as  partial-order methods  that can significantly reduce the running time of formal validation by avoiding redundant exploration of execution scenarios. In this paper, we describe the design of a partial-order algorithm for our validation tool and discuss its effectiveness. We show that a careful compile-time static analysis of process communication behavior yields information that can be used during validation to dramatically improve its performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our partial-order algorithm by presenting the results of experiments with actual industrial examples drawn from a variety of 5ESS \&amp;trade;  application domains, including call processing, signalling, and switch maintenance.},

State space abstraction, having been essential for verifying designs of industrial complexity, is typically a manual process, requiring considerable creativity and insight.In this article, we present an automatic iterative abstraction-refinement methodology that extends symbolic model checking. In our method, the initial abstract model is generated by an automatic analysis of the control structures in the program to be verified. Abstract models may admit erroneous (or "spurious") counterexamples. We devise new symbolic techniques that analyze such counterexamples and refine the abstract model correspondingly. We describe aSMV, a prototype implementation of our methodology in NuSMV. Practical experiments including a large Fujitsu IP core design with about 500 latches and 10000 lines of SMV code confirm the effectiveness of our approach.},

In this paper their work is extended: Several critical system parameters, including various synchrony conditions, are identified and how varying these affects the number of faults that can be tolerated is examined.

Sanders has pointed out what seem to be a counterintuitive property of knowledge-based programs. Roughly speaking, they do not satisfy a certain monotonicity property, while standard programs (ones without tests for knowledge) do. It is shown that there are two ways of defining the monotonicity property, which agree for standard programs. Knowledge-based programs satisfy the first, but do not satisfy the second. It is further argued by example that the fact that they do not satisfy the second is actually a feature, not a problem. Moreover, once we allow the more general class of knowledge-based specifications, standard programs do not satisfy the monotonicity property either.},

@inproceedings{HvHK03:conDEL,
    abstract = {When giving an analysis of knowledge in multiagent systems, one needs a framework in which higher-order information and its dynamics can both be represented. A recent tradition starting in original work by Plaza treats all of knowledge, higher-order knowledge, and its dynamics on the same foot. Our work is in that tradition. It also fits in approaches that not only dynamize the epistemics, but also epistemize the dynamics: the actions that (groups of) agents perform are epistemic actions. Different agents may have different information about which action is taking place, including higher-order information. We demonstrate that such information changes require subtle descriptions. The contribution of our paper is that it provides a complete axiomatization for an action language of van Ditmarsch, where an action is interpreted as a relation between states and sets of states. The applicability of the framework is found in every context where multiagent strategic decision making is at stake, and already demonstrated in game-like scenarios such as Cluedo and card games.},

    abstract = {Reasoning about knowledge seems to play a fundamental role in distributed systems. Indeed, such reasoning is a central part of the informal intuitive arguments used in the design of distributed protocols. Communication in a distributed system can be viewed as the act of transforming the system's state of knowledge. This paper presents a general framework for formalizing and reasoning about knowledge in distributed systems. It is shown that states of knowledge of groups of processors are useful concepts for the design and analysis of distributed protocols. In particular,  distributed knowledge  corresponds to knowledge that is \&ldquo;distributed\&rdquo; among the members of the group, while  common knowledge  corresponds to a fact being \&ldquo;publicly known.\&rdquo; The relationship between common knowledge and a variety of desirable actions in a distributed system is illustrated. Furthermore, it is shown that, formally speaking, in practical systems common knowledge cannot be attained. A number of weaker variants of common knowledge that are attainable in many cases of interest are introduced and investigated.},

The possible worlds model and its associated Kripke semantics provide an intuitive semantics for these logics, but they seem to commit us to model agents that are logically omniscient (they believe every classical tautology) and perfect reasoners (their beliefs are closed under classical deductive closure). Thus, this model does not seem to be appropriate to model non-ideal agents, that have resource limitations that can prevent them from attaining such levels of doxastic competence. This article contains a statement of these problems and a survey of some of the most interesting approaches that have been suggested to overcome them.},

In particular, even if data constructors, message depth, message width, number of distinct roles, role length, and depth of encryption are bounded by constants, secrecy is an undecidable property. If protocols are further restricted to have no new data (nonces), then secrecy is dexptime-complete. Both lower bounds are obtained by encoding decision problems from existential Horn theories without function symbols into our protocol framework. The way that encryption and adversary behavior are used in the reduction sheds some light on protocol analysis.},

However, this is absolutely not the case: bugs are routinely found in well known protocols, and years after they were first published. The problem is the presence of a hostile opponent, who can alter messages at will. In effect, our task is to program a computer which gives answers which are subtly and maliciously wrong at the most inconvenient possible moment.

The theory is formulated for CryptoSPA, a process algebra we introduced for the specification of cryptographic protocols. One of the advantages of our unifying GNDC-based theory is that that formal comparison among security properties become easier, being them all instances of a unique general property. Moreover, the full generality of the approach has helped us in finding a few undocumented attacks on cryptographic protocols.},

We use awareness to model the agents' resource-bounded reasoning and, in doing so, capture a more appropriate notion of belief than those usually considered in security logics. We also address the problem of modeling interleaved protocol executions, adapting ideas from inductive methods for protocol verification. The result is an intuitive, but expressive, doxastic logic for formalizing and reasoning about attacks. As a case study, we use awareness to characterize, and demonstrate the existence of, a man-in-the-middle attack upon the Needham-Schroeder Public Key protocol. This is, to our knowledge, not only the first doxastic analysis of this attack but also the first practical application of an awareness logic. Even though defining the awareness sets of the agents, a task that is left unspecified in formal works on awareness logics, turns out to be surprisingly subtle, initial results suggest that our approach is promising for modeling, verifying and reasoning about security protocols and their properties.},

A common model is the Dolev-Yao model, which considers only adversaries that can compose and replay messages, and decipher them with known keys. The Dolev-Yao model is a useful ion, but it suffers from some drawbacks: it cannot handle the adversary knowing protocol-specific information, and it cannot handle probabilistic notions, such as the adversary attempting to guess the keys. We show how we can analyze security protocols under different adversary models by using a logic with a notion of algorithmic knowledge. Roughly speaking, adversaries are assumed to use algorithms to compute their knowledge; adversary capabilities are captured by suitable restrictions on the algorithms used. We show how we can model the standard Dolev-Yao adversary in this setting, and how we can capture more general capabilities including protocol-specific knowledge and guesses.},

We previously introduced a Logic of Local Name Containment that has a clear semantics and was shown to completely characterize SDSI name resolution. Here we show how our earlier approach can be extended to deal with a number of key features of SPKI, including revocation, expiry dates, and tuple reduction. We show that these extensions add relatively little complexity to the logic. In particular, we do not need a nonmonotonic logic to capture revocation. We then use our semantics to examine SPKI's tuple reduction rules. Our analysis highlights places where SPKI's informal description of tuple reduction is somewhat vague, and shows that extra reduction rules are necessary in order to capture general information about binding and authorization.},

In this view, strategies are not plans formulated by rational agents considering all possible futures and (mutually recursively) taking into account strategies employed by other players. Instead, they are partial; players start with a set of potential strategies and dynamically switch between them. This necessitates some means in the model for players to access each others' strategies, and we suggest a syntax by which players' rationale for such switching may be specified and structurally composed. In such a model one can ask a stability question: given a game arena and a strategy specification, whether players eventually settle down to strategies without further switching. We show that this problem can be algorithmically solved using automata theoretic methods.},

Correlatively, Williamson's margin for error semantics for inexact knowledge invalidates axioms 4 and 5. We present a new semantics for modal logic which is shown to be complete for K45, without constraining the accessibility relation to be transitive or euclidean. The semantics corresponds to a system of modular knowledge, in which iterated modalities and simple modalities are not on a par. We show how the semantics helps to solve Williamson's luminosity paradox, and argue that it corresponds to an integrated model of perceptual and introspective knowledge that is psychologically more plausible than the one defended by Williamson. We formulate a generalized version of the semantics, called token semantics, in which modalities are iteration-sensitive up to degree n and insensitive beyond n. The multi-agent version of the semantics yields a resource-sensitive logic with implications for the representation of common knowledge in situations of bounded rationality.},

However, by using epistemic logic (logic of knowledge) to model the protocols, anonymity becomes an easily verifiable epistemic formula. We propose using Dynamic Epistemic Logic to model security protocols and properties, in particular anonymity properties. We have built tool support for DEL verification which reuses state-of-the-art tool support for automata-based verification. We illustrate this approach by analyzing an anonymous broadcast protocol and an electronic voting protocol. By comparison with a process-based analysis of the same protocols, we also discuss the relative (dis)advantages of the process-based and epistemic-based verification methods in general.},

We add this operation to a whole range of process algebra axiom systems, starting from BPA (Basic Process Algebra). In the case of the most complex system under consideration, ACP{tau}, every regular process can be defined with handshaking (two-party communication) and auxiliary actions. Next we introduce nesting in process algebra: x\#y is defined by the equation x\#y = x(x\#y)x + y. We show that * and \# are not interdefinable in most of the axiom systems we regard. The extension with \#, and the extension with * and \# of the systems considered also give a genuine hierarchy in expressivity. Finally, it is argued that each finitely branching, computable graph can be defined in ACP{tau} extended with * and \#, and using handshaking and auxiliary actions. 10.1093/comjnl/37.4.243},

We represent incomplete state spaces as partial Kripke structures, and give a 3-valued interpretation to modal logic formulas on these structures. The third truth value ? means  ?????? unknown whether true or false??????. We define a preorder on partial Kripke structures that reflects their degree of completeness. We then provide a logical characterization of this preorder. This characterization thus relates properties of less complete structures to properties of more complete structures. We present similar results for labeled transition systems and show a connection to intuitionistic modal logic.

When designing a model-checker, a good compromise must be made between the expressive power of the property description formalism, the complexity of the model-checking problem, and the user-friendliness of the interface. We present a temporal logic and an associated model-checking method that attempt to fulfill these criteria. The logic is an extension of the alternation-free ????-calculus with A  -like action formulas and P  -like regular expressions, allowing a concise and intuitive description of safety, liveness, and fairness properties over labeled transition systems. The model-checking method is based upon a succinct translation of the verification problem into a boolean equation system, which is solved by means of an efficient local algorithm having a good average complexity. The algorithm also allows to generate full diagnostic information (examples and counterexamples) for temporal formulas. This method is at the heart of the E   3.0 model-checker that we implemented within the C   toolbox using the generic O  /C   environment for on-the-fly verification.},

teaching, and industrial practice on this important subject. The authors

Model checking is a technique for verifying finite state concurrent systems
such as sequential circuit designs and communication protocols. It has a
number of advantages over traditional approaches that are based on simulation,
testing, and deductive reasoning. In particular, model checking is automatic
and usually quite fast. Also, if the design contains an error, model checking
will produce a counterexample that can be used to pinpoint the source of the
error. The method, which was awarded the 1999 ACM Paris Kanellakis Award for
Theory and Practice, has been used successfully in practice to verify real
industrial designs, and companies are beginning to market commercial model
checkers.

The main challenge in model checking is dealing with the state space explosion
problem. This problem occurs in systems with many components that can interact
with each other or systems with data structures that can assume many different
values. In such cases the number of global states can be enormous. Researchers
have made considerable progress on this problem over the last ten years.

This is the first comprehensive presentation of the theory and practice of
model checking. The book, which includes basic as well as state-of-the-art
techniques, algorithms, and tools, can be used both as an introduction to the
subject and as a reference for researchers.},

@article{CDLV02,
    abstract = {Recent work on semi-structured data has revitalized the interest in path queries, i.e., queries that ask for all pairs of objects in the database that are connected by a path conforming to a certain specification, in particular to a regular expression. Also, in semi-structured data, as well as in data integration, data warehousing, and query optimization, the problem of view-based query rewriting is receiving much attention: Given a query and a collection of views, generate a new query which uses the views and provides the answer to the original one. In this paper we address the problem of view-based query rewriting in the context of semi-structured data. We present a method for computing the rewriting of a regular expression  E  in terms of other regular expressions. The method computes the exact rewriting (the one that defines the same regular language as  E ) if it exists, or the rewriting that defines the maximal language contained in the one defined by  E , otherwise. We present a complexity analysis of both the problem and the method, showing that the latter is essentially optimal. Finally, we illustrate how to exploit the method for view-based rewriting of regular path queries in semi-structured data. The complexity results established for the rewriting of regular expressions apply also to the case of regular path queries.},

@article{GroupAJ,
    abstract = {Two currently active strands of research on logics for multi-agent systems are dynamic epistemic logic, focusing on the epistemic consequences of actions, and logics of coalitional ability, focusing on what coalitions of agents can achieve by cooperating strategically. In this paper we bridge these topics by considering the question:  ?????? what can a coalition achieve by making public announcements???????. We propose an extension of public announcement logic with constructs of the form  G , where  G  is a group of agents, with the intuitive meaning that  G  can jointly execute a  publicly observable  action such that   will be true afterwards. Actions here are taken to be  truthful public announcements , but turn out also to include  sequences  of such joint actions as well as protocols with alternating actions by different agents, in response to the actions of others. We also study in detail the difference between 'knowing how' (knowing de re) and 'knowing that' (knowing de dicto) in our framework: both can elegantly be expressed in the single-agent case. We present several meta-logical properties of this  Group Announcement Logic , including a sound and complete axiomatization, expressivity and the complexity of model checking.},

@article{MergingJournal09,
    abstract = {Abstract\&nbsp;\&nbsp;A variety of logical frameworks have been developed to study rational agents interacting over time. This paper takes a closer look at one particular interface, between two systems that both address the dynamics of knowledge and information flow. The first is Epistemic Temporal Logic (ETL) which uses linear or branching time models with added epistemic structure induced by agents' different capabilities for observing events. The second framework is Dynamic Epistemic Logic (DEL) that describes interactive processes in terms of epistemic event models which may occur inside modalities of the language. This paper systematically and rigorously relates the DEL framework with the ETL framework. The precise relationship between DEL and ETL is explored via a new representation theorem characterizing the largest class of ETL models corresponding to DEL protocols in terms of notions of Perfect Recall, No Miracles, and Bisimulation Invariance. We then focus on new issues of completeness. One contribution is an axiomatization for the dynamic logic of public announcements constrained by protocols, which has been an open problem for some years, as it does not fit the usual 'reduction axiom' format of DEL. Finally, we provide a number of examples that show how DEL suggests an interesting fine-structure inside ETL.},

It is often more practical in such environments to enable agents to actively extend their knowledge as part of their plans and then revise their decisions in light of these update. In this paper, we describe a new principled approach to Continual Planning, i.e. the integration of Planning, Execution and Monitoring. The algorithm deliberately postpones parts of the planning process to later stages in an agent's plan-act-monitor cycle and automatically determines when to switch back to refining or revising a partly executed plan.},

Every atomic proposition in a rational Kripke model is evaluated in a rational set of states. We show that every formula of K t has an effectively computable rational extension in every rational Kripke model, and therefore local model checking and global model checking of K t in rational Kripke models are decidable.

The regular sets of guarded strings play the same role in Kleene algebra with tests as the regular sets of ordinary strings do in Kleene algebra. In this paper we develop the elementary theory of finite automata on guarded strings, a generalization of the theory of finite automata on ordinary strings. We give several basic constructions, including determinization, state minimization, and an analog of Kleene''s theorem. We then use these results to verify a conjecture on the complexity of a complete Gentzen-style sequent calculus for \partial correctness. We also show that a basic result of the theory of Boolean decision diagrams (BDDs), namely that minimal ordered BDDs are unique, is a special case of the Myhill-Nerode theorem for a class of automata on guarded strings.},

@article{PHMoss08:RelationalSyllogistics,
    abstract = {The Aristotelian syllogistic cannot account for the validity of many
inferences involving relational facts. In this paper, we investigate the
prospects for providing a relational syllogistic. We identify several fragments
based on (a) whether negation is permitted on all nouns, including those in the
subject of a sentence; and (b) whether the subject noun phrase may contain a
relative clause. The logics we present are extensions of the classical
syllogistic, and we pay special attention to the question of whether reductio
ad absurdum is needed. Thus our main goal is to derive results on the existence
(or non-existence) of syllogistic proof systems for relational fragments. We
also determine the computational complexity of all our fragments.},

@inproceedings{CTLforGenetic,
    abstract = {Model checking has proven to be a useful analysis technique not only for concurrent systems, but also for the genetic regulatory networks (Grns) that govern the functioning of living cells. The applications of model checking in systems biology have revealed that temporal logics should be able to capture both branching-time and fairness properties. At the same time, they should have a user-friendly syntax easy to employ by non-experts. In this paper, we define Ctrl (Computation Tree Regular Logic), an extension of Ctl with regular expressions and fairness operators that attempts to match these criteria. Ctrlsubsumes both Ctl and Ltl, and has a reduced set of temporal operators indexed by regular expressions, inspired from the modalities of Pdl (Propositional Dynamic Logic). We also develop a translation of Ctrl into HmlR (Hennessy-Milner Logic with Recursion), an equational variant of the modal ????-calculus. This has allowed us to obtain an on-the-fly model checker with diagnostic for Ctrl by directly reusing the verification technology available in the Cadp toolbox. We illustrate the application of the Ctrl model checker by analyzing the Grn controlling the carbon starvation response of Escherichia coli.},

@article{Fagin96:CompareGames,
    abstract = {The descriptive complexity of a problem is the complexity of describing the problem in some logical formalism. One of the few techniques for proving separation results in descriptive complexity is to make use of games on graphs played between two players, called the spoiler and the duplicator. There are two types of these games, which differ in the order in which the spoiler and duplicator make various moves. In one of these games, the rules seem to be tilted towards favoring the duplicator. These seemingly more favorable rules make it easier to prove separation results, since separation results are proven by showing that the duplicator has a winning strategy. In this paper, the relationship between these games is investigated. It is shown that in one sense, the two games are equivalent. Specifically, each family of graphs used in one game (the game with the seemingly more favorable rules for the duplicator) to prove a separation result can in principle be used in the other game to prove the same result. This answers an open question of Ajtai and the author from 1989. It is also shown that in another sense, the games are not equivalent, in that there are situations where the spoiler requires strictly more resources to win one game than the other game. This makes formal the informal statement that one game is easier for the duplicator to win.},

@article{DaGrKre06:TCSgame,
    abstract = {We define a new class of games, called backtracking games. Backtracking games are essentially parity games with an additional rule allowing players, under certain conditions, to return to an earlier position in the play and revise a choice or to force a countback of the number of moves. This new feature makes backtracking games more powerful than parity games. As a consequence, winning strategies become more complex objects and computationally harder. The corresponding increase in expressiveness allows us to use backtracking games as model-checking games for inflationary fixed-point logics such as IFP or MIC. We identify a natural subclass of backtracking games, the simple games, and show that these are the "right" model-checking games for IFP by (a) giving a translation of formulae \&\#981; and structures U into simple games such that U = \&\#966; if, and only if, Player 0 wins the corresponding game and (b) showing that the winner of simple backtracking games can again be defined in IFP.},

In this paper, we show how such power indices can be applied to understanding the relative importance of agents when we attempt to devise a coordination mechanism using the paradigm of social laws, or normative systems. Understanding how pivotal an agent is with respect to the success of a particular social law is of benefit when designing such social laws: we might typically aim to ensure that power is distributed evenly amongst the agents in a system, to avoid bottlenecks or single points of failure. After formally defining the framework and illustrating the role of power indices in it, we investigate the complexity of computing these indices, showing that the characteristic complexity result is \#P-completeness. We then investigate cases where computing indices is computationally easy.},

@article{PlanRev06,
    abstract = {In this paper, we present a dynamic logic for a propositional version of the agent programming language 3APL. A 3APL agent has beliefs and a plan. The execution of a plan changes an agent's beliefs. Plans can be revised during execution by means of plan revision rules. Due to these plan revision capabilities of 3APL agents, plans cannot be analyzed by structural induction as in for example standard propositional dynamic logic. We propose a dynamic logic that is tailored to handle the plan revision aspect of 3APL. The logic is one for plans that are restricted in a certain way. For this logic, we give a sound and complete axiomatization. Further, we discuss how this logic for restricted 3APL plans can be extended to a logic for non-restricted plans and we discuss some example proofs, using the logic. Finally, we consider the relation between proving properties of 3APL agents and proving properties of procedural programs.},

    abstract = {The Dolev--Yao model is a useful and widespread framework in which to analyze security protocols. However, it models the messages of the protocol at a very high level and makes extremely strong assumptions about the power of the adversary. The computational model of cryptography and cryptographic protocols takes a much more low-level view of messages and uses much weaker assumptions. A major result of this work will be the demonstration that certain kinds of computational cryptography can result in an equivalence of sorts between the formal and computational adversary. Specifically, we give an interpretation to the messages of the Dolev--Yao model in terms of computational cryptography. We then define a computational security condition on the powers of the computational adversary, and show that this condition limits the computational adversary to the operations of the Dolev--Yao adversary. Lastly, we show that this security condition is achievable using standard computational cryptographic constructs.},
