It is easy to see that $\KHiMLlogic$ is strictly more expressive than $\KHilogic$.
Consider for instance, the models $\modults$ and $\modults'$ from the proof of~\Cref{prop:exppal}. It has been established therein that the models are $\KHilogic$-bisimilar. However, $\modults',w'\models\mldiam{b}\top$ while  $\modults,w\not\models\mldiam{b}\top$. Thus, they are distinguishable by an $\KHiMLlogic$-formula. 
%  two models can depict an agent with the same abilities, thus indistinguishable for the second, and yet use different witness for that, thus distinguishable for the first. \carlos{No se pueden usar modelos anteriores para hacer este claim más formal? En particular, no usaría la palabra "abilities" acá.}
Moreover, $\KHiMLlogic$ is also strictly more expressive than the standard multi-modal language $\mathsf{L}_{\square}$, as the global modality is definable in the former, but not in the latter.
