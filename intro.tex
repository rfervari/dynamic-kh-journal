% #4.1: knowing that + its dynamics + how those ideas can be used for knowing how (KH)
The notion of \emph{knowing that} has been one of the fundamental study subjects in Epistemology. It concerns the knowledge an agent might have about the truth-value of propositions, and as such has driven most of the field's research agenda, with some authors even claiming that it subsumes many other forms of knowledge \cite{BoenLycan75}. 
 
One of the most successful formal tools for studying this concept has been epistemic logic (EL; \cite{Hintikka:kab}), a formal logical framework whose formulas are typically interpreted in pointed Kripke models~\cite{mlbook,HML}. In more detail, a Kripke model is a relational structure whose domain's elements (called possible states/situations/worlds) represent the different ways the real world could be, and in which a binary relation (the epistemic indistinguishability relation) represents the agent's uncertainty. Then, a pointed Kripke model is a Kripke model with a distinguished evaluation state, usually understood as describing the actual situation. With this, knowledge about the truth-value of propositions is defined as follows: at a given state $w$, the agent knows that a proposition $\varphi$ is true if and only if $\varphi$ holds in all the states she cannot distinguish from $w$. Asking for the indistinguishability relation to be reflexive, transitive and Euclidean (i.e., an equivalence relation) makes knowledge truthful, positively and negatively introspective. EL has proved to be a useful tool for developments in, e.g., Philosophy \cite{rfe,Holliday2018}, Computer Science \cite{RAK}, AI \cite{elfaics} and Economics \cite{egepgt}. In achieving this, one of its most appealing aspects is that it can be used to reason about information change. Indeed, actions working towards increasing the agent's knowledge can be straightforwardly represented as model operations that remove edges, thus reducing the agent's uncertainty. Further research on this idea has given rise to dynamic epistemic logic (DEL; \cite{DELbook,vanBenthem2011ldii}), a field that studies how the attitudes of an agent (or a set of agents) change through diverse informational actions.

% #1: motivating KH
Still, \emph{knowing that} is not the only form of knowledge an agent might have and use. In fact, the last few years have witnessed the emergence of a new family of epistemic languages for reasoning about \emph{knowing whether}, \emph{knowing how}, \emph{knowing why}, \emph{knowing what} and so on (see \cite{Wang16} for an overview). Among them, \emph{knowing how} (e.g.,~\cite{Pavese22}) is one of the most important, as it concerns an agent's \emph{ability} to achieve a given outcome. Intuitively, an agent knows how to achieve~$\varphi$ given~$\psi$ if she has at her disposal a suitable \emph{course of action} guaranteeing that $\varphi$ will be the case whenever she is in a situation in which $\psi$ holds. This concept is important not only from a philosophical perspective but also from a computer science point of view, as it can be seen as a formal account for automated planning and strategic reasoning in AI (see, e.g.,~\cite{KandA15}).

% #2: knowing that (KT) + ability is not enough, and a brief description of LTS semantics
Most traditional approaches for representing \emph{knowing how} rely on combining logics of \emph{knowing that} with logics of action (see, e.g.,~\cite{Mccarthy69,Les00,HerzigT06}). However, while a combination of operators for \emph{knowing that} and \emph{ability} (e.g.,~\cite{wiebeetal:2003}) produces a \emph{de dicto} reading of the concept (\emph{``the agent knows she has an action that guarantees the goal''}), a proper notion of \emph{``knowing how to achieve $\varphi$''} requires a \emph{de re} clause (\emph{``the agent has an action that she knows guarantees the goal''}; see~\cite{JamrogaA07,Herzig15} for a discussion). Based on these considerations, \cite{Wang15lori,Wang2016} introduced a new framework based on a \emph{knowing how} binary modality $\kh(\psi,\varphi)$. At the semantic level, this language is also interpreted over relational models --- called transition systems (LTSs) in this context. The difference with respect to the EL setting is that, here, relations describe the actions an agent has at her disposal for their execution (in some sense, her \emph{abilities}).
%An edge labeled $a$ going from state $w$ to state $u$ indicates that the agent can execute action $a$ to go from $w$ to $u$. Thus,
Then, $\kh(\psi,\varphi)$ holds if and only if there is a ``proper plan'' (a sequence of actions satisfying certain constraints) in the LTS that unerringly leads from every $\psi$-state only to $\varphi$-states.


% #3: introducing indistinguishability and discussing its benefits
While variants of this idea have been explored in the literature (see, e.g.,~\cite{Li17,LiWang17,FervariHLW17,Wang19a}),
%weakens the contraints on the required plan, \cite{LiWang17} adds requirements on the plan's intermediate states, \cite{FervariHLW17} combines it with a \emph{knowing that} operator.}
most of them share the fundamental feature mentioned above: relations in the model are interpreted as the agent's available actions. Due to this, the abilities of an agent depend \emph{only} on what these actions can achieve. The framework presented in~\cite{AFSVQ21,AFSVQ23report} changed this underlying idea by adding a notion of ``indistinguishability'' between plans, related to the notion of \emph{strategy indistinguishability} of, e.g.,~\cite{JamrogaH04,Belardinelli14}. Two main insights are introduced in these articles. The first is simple: while certain actions might be available in a given environment, they might not be available \emph{to a given agent} (e.g., she might not know about them, or did not consider them at the given time). Hence, not all possible plans are available to all agents.  More importantly, she might consider some of these actions or plans \emph{indistinguishable}\footnote{The exact meaning of ``indistinguishable'' is left open. In particular, it does not necessarily mean that the agent cannot tell the plans apart, it might just be that she considers the differences not relevant.} from some others. In such cases, having available a proper plan $\plan$ that leads from any $\psi$-state to only $\varphi$-states is not enough: the agent also needs for \emph{all the plans she cannot distinguish from $\plan$} to satisfy the same requirement. As argued in~\cite{AFSVQ21}, the benefits of these new semantics are threefold. First, it provides an indistinguishability-based view of an agent's abilities, akin to the EL approach for modelling \emph{knowing that}. Second, it enables us to deal with multi-agent scenarios more naturally. Third, it leads to a natural definition of operators representing dynamic aspects of \emph{knowing how}, akin to the DEL approach for modelling dynamics of \emph{knowing that}.
%
% This is in sharp contrast with standard epistemic logic (EL)~\cite{Hintikka:kab}, where relational models have two kinds of information: ontic facts about a given situation (represented by the current state in the model), and the particular perspective that agents have (represented by the possible states available in the model, and their respective indistinguishability relation between them). If one would like to mirror the situation of EL, it seems natural that \emph{knowing how} should be defined in terms of some kind of indistinguishability over the  information provided by an LTS.  Such an extended model would be able to capture both the abilities of an agent as given by her available actions, together with the (in)abilities that arise when considering two different actions/plans/executions indistinguishable.
%
%Syntactically, its main component is a binary modality $\khi(\psi,\varphi)$, for each agent~$i$.  Semantically, the crucial idea is the inclusion of an indistinguishability relation between plans over an \lts for each agent $i$, on top of the \lts.
%
%The new structures are called \emph{uncertainty-based \lts} (\ults). Then, formulas are interpreted over \ultss. In this proposal, an agent may have different alternatives at her disposal to try to achieve a goal, all ``as good as any other'' (and in that sense indistinguishable) as far as she can tell. In this way, \ultss aim to reintroduce the notion of epistemic indistinguishability, now at the level of plans.
%

\smallskip

This paper focuses on the latter point, using this in\-dis\-tin\-guisha\-bil\-i\-ty-based semantics to investigate several dynamic operators describing changes in the agents' abilities and/or their perception of them. In these structures, while the underlying LTS represents \emph{ontic} information which is common to all agents, indistinguishability over plans models the \emph{epistemic} perception of each particular agent. Thus, following the DEL approach, one can define different model-changing operations representing different ontic and informational actions. Indeed, changes in the LTS can be seen as ontic updates, and then changes in plan indistinguishability represent epistemic updates. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time in which this theme is addressed (except by the brief discussion introduced in~\cite{Wang2016} about announcements in the context of knowing how, and the work in~\cite{AFSV22} that this paper extends). 

% #5: contents: two forms of updates, and mention of the results for each one.
\fer{Still to revise}The paper starts by investigating operators that update models based on some sort of \emph{announcement}, in the spirit of~\cite{Plaza89:lopc}. By following closely standard definitions of announcements, the operation results in an ontic update in our setting. This is because accessibility relations and states in the LTS represent objective information available for the agents. Then, we will define operations that perform epistemic updates. In particular, we will discuss ways in which the indistinguishability relation between plans can be refined, causing some change in the agents' knowledge. With these proposals, we illustrate the difficulties of dealing with this kind of modalities in the context of knowing how logics. More precisely, we will present the main challenges that arise in axiomatizing these new dynamic modalities. We discuss both how the failure of the uniform substitution property in the logics, and the weak expressive power of the base static logic are obstacles in defining a complete axiomatization for some dynamic modalities. As a consequence, as a novelty with respect to~\cite{AFSV22}, we introduce a new proposal, in which we extend the underlying (static) knowing how logic, with basic modalities $\mlbox{a}$, for each action $a$, and with a dynamic modality $\srefbox{\plan}$, revealing the possibility of executing $\plan$, and differentiating it from the rest of the available plans. With this additional expressivity, we can obtain a completeness result for the resulting dynamic logic, via reduction axioms.

\noindent\textbf{Outline:} This article is organized as follows. \Cref{sec:basic} ecalls the basic definitions of the indistinguishability-based knowing how setting (\cite{AFSVQ21,AFSVQ23report}), including results that are useful in the rest of this manuscript.  Interestingly, we show that one of the axioms presented in~\cite{AFSVQ21,AFSVQ23report} can be removed as it is derivable from the others. In~\Cref{sec:ontic} ontic updates are investigated, based on public announcements~\cite{Plaza89:lopc} and arrow updates~\cite{KooiR11}. We discuss the properties of the operations, and provide reduction axioms over a very restricted class of models. In~\Cref{sec:epistemic-basic} we provide alternatives for epistemic updates, and discuss some of their semantic properties. In particular, we prove that uniform substitution does not hold in general. \Cref{sec:extension} introduces a new proposal in which epistemic updates are defined over an extended language, and provides a complete axiomatization via reduction axioms. Moreover, we show that the satisfiability problem for the resulting logics is decidable, using filtrations. Finally, in~\Cref{sec:final} we offer some final remarks and discuss future lines of work.
